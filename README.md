# Basic-Ethereum-Contract

This is the first contract created by me using solidity for coding 
web3 library for connecting it to the network 
And deployed the contract on Rinkeby Network 


The contract has two basic functions : 
message() -> just returns the value stored in the message variable 
setMessage() -> sets the message variable on the contract deployed on the blockchain.  

Contract is deployed on Rinkeby Network at the address : 0x35fB08EbA56d8E5923Ac8C79b83819fd0312eD06
